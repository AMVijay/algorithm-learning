## Introduction 
There are lot of sorting algorithms available for linear datastructure (such as List, Array) sorting. In this post, will provide some level of details about each sorting algorithms and comparison

## Sorting Algorithms
* Binary Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
## Overview and Comparison

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Binary Insertion Sort</th>
    <th>Merge Sort</th>
    <th>Quick Sort</th>
  <tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Find the middle element and bisect the data collecton into two separate and iterate the same step until each collection has 2 at max. Then, compare and swap data till it sorted fully.
    </td>
